This program is a great starting point for beginners learning the C++ programming language. It provides a basic introduction to the standard output stream (cout) and the basic structure of a C++ program.

## Tutorial :
### Creating the C++ File
1. Open your favorite text editor and create a new file called "hello.cpp".
2. Type the following code into the file:

    return 0;
}
```
3. Save the file in a directory of your choice.

### Adding it to Github
1. Open Git Bash in the same directory as the "hello.cpp" file.
2. Initialize a new local repository by running the command :
```
$ git init
```
3. Add the "hello.cpp" file to the repository by running the command :
```
$ git add hello.cpp
```
4. Commit the changes with a commit message by running the command :
```
$ git commit -m "Initial commit: Hello World program"
```
5. Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository.
6. Run the following commands to link your local repository with the remote repository on GitHub or follow the instruction on screen :
```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/helloworld.git
$ git push -u origin master
```
